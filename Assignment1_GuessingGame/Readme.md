# Prompt

I was always impressed by those folks at the amusement parks and country fairs who could perform magic tricks. I even remember once getting a booklet where if you asked someone enough questions in a row, you could guess their date of birth. It was a sort of neat magic trick, but back then (when I was about five years old) I did not realize I was being tricked by a programmer! 

Letâ€™s figure out how to write a similar program to guess a randomly generated number by the computer.

# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_usernamename@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

# Part 1 - Establishing your work environment

## VIM and TMUX

(Note this part is ungraded--but you are required to do it!)

Figuring out a good workflow on Unix, Mac, (and even windows) is an important part of becoming a good programmer. My work environment (and the suggested one so I can help you during class), is to use the combination of the VIM text editor and tmux window manager to program your assignments in.

### Student and Teacher Dialouge

*"But I love visual studio, sublime, XCode, Atom, etc."*

*That's great, but you cannot use those in a remote environment easily--so I suggest learning another skill. By all means, use both or multiple tools to write the highest quality code.*

*"Hehe, the professor will never know if I just use notepad. I'll just take a shortcut on this assignment"*

*While that's true you can take a shortcut now, it will eventually catch up to you. I promise this is a good skill to learn! This first assignment is much more lightweight, take the time now to do things properly.*

Here are some suggested resources to get started.

* Type *man tmux* in a terminal.
* Tmux tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHhA_ZKjyxo (11:23)

> A hint I got a long time ago from a colleague when working, is to ask a colleague if you can shadow them working for 30 minutes.
> It was interesting to see what different tools other computer scientists would use. Whether it was different text editors, short-cuts, plugin-ins, etc.
> Establishing a good workflow can even be part of the fun!

# Part 2 - Guessing Game in C

Implement in the main.c file. Do not forget to 'push' your changes.

TBD




# Resources to help



# Rubric

* 100% Guessing Game
    * %50 Program Style
	* %50 Program Correctnesss

* Note: Your code **must** run on the Khoury machines. That is where you should test it, and this is where we grade it!
* Note: You must also commit any additional files into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!

# Feedback Loop

(An optional task that will reinforce your learning throughout the semester)
